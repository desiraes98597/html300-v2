        <blockquote>I became interested in web design way back in 1998, when I worked for a small electronics company who had no web site presence.
            Of course, at the time web sites very rudenmentry and had to be hand coded. I created a huge online catalog presence for this company
            and found I could work for hours and not even be phased. I loved it. I did not know anything, so I had to teach myself from scratch
            and back then there was not even css, or least not that I knew, so lots and lots of tables. :-). After that company cloaed in 2008 due to 
            economic hit, I went back to school for web design. Received a certificate, and then never worked in the field. I was intimated and 
            suffered from imposter syndrome enough to keep me out of the job market. Fast forward to now and I am back, trying to learn all the skills
            I did not back in 2010. Things have changed so much.
